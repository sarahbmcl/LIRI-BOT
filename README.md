###LIRI BOT

This is LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will search the following APIs:
* Spotify for songs
* Bands in Town for concerts
* OMDB for movies

Use the following commands to activate LIRI:
* help (to list all commands)
* concert-this (followed by an artist)
* spotify-this-song (followed by a song)
* movie-this (followed by a movie)
* do-what-it-says (to run random.txt)
